# Lime

An easy way to build ecommerce stores fast.

# Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You will need to [install docker](https://www.docker.com/) on your local machine.

### Installation

To get started with Lime locally, follow these steps

1. Get a local copy of your repo
   ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/coding1101/lime
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory

   ```sh
   cd ecommerce-admin
   ```

3. Install NPM packages(We suggest using `pnpm`)
   ```sh
   pnpm install
   ```
4. Start a docker container for the database.
   ```sh
   docker-compose up
   ```
5. Copy `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env` and edit the values. Keep the `DATABASE_URL` the same unless you changed the `docker-compose.yml` file.

6. Once your database is ready, push your schema to the database.
   ```sh
   pnpm prisma db push
   ```
7. Finally start your dev server.
   ```sh
   pnpm dev
   ```
8. To view the database
   ```sh
   pnpm prisma studio
   ```

Open your browser and visit http://localhost:3000 to see the application running.
